<h2>Refugee Resource Hub Application and Site</h2>
<h3><i class="fa fa-cloud"></i> Concept:</h3>
<p>
   ​A hub to provide access to and information around services beyond language services ­– building beyond 4W’s mapping of services – a real­time location­ based digital and mobile waypoint for refugees and service providers.
</p>

<h3><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> Need:</h3>
<p>
 ​Services offerings are so disperse and difficult to understand refugees need a simple, universally understandable means to access and connect various services at a local level.
</p>
<p>
  <h3><i class="fa fa-users"></i> Potential Partners:</h3> U​niversities in computer science; Google, UNHCR in oversight of refugee services in various countries where organizations are operating.
</p>

<h3><i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o"></i> Solution(s) Proposed:</h3>
<p>
  ​​A complete app and digital suite, easily accessible across platforms, the solution itself would allow refugees themselves to provide feedback in­ the app interface. The Yelp­-like suite of services available for refugees would allow refugees or service providers to search by type of service and geographic area; this resource might also include employment tools and crawl existing resources to surface employment opportunities.
</p>

<h3><i class="fa fa-key"></i> Key Milestones:</h3>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>​Local NGOs, international NGOs provide connected detail around the types of work and services they have built on the ground. Applying a "period of performance" will ensure all content remains relevant. Information would expire within and appropriate time horizon.
    </li>
    <li>
      Notes: ICT for Programs has a service point app (IRC); via UNHCR Innovation, help.unhcr.org​ can potentially help keep content relevant and current.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  <h3><i class="fa fa-question"></i> Key questions:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      What organizations have bandwidth to develop this tool?
    </li>
    <li>
      What services are the necessary, core services to include in this app?
    </li>
    <li>
      Are there any organizations or actors with services operating with location­based databases to incorporate into this initiative?
    </li>
  </ul>
