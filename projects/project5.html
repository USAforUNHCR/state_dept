<h2>Solution: Mobile Language Lab Application</h2>
<h3><i class="fa fa-cloud"></i> Concept:</h3>
<p>
   ​Partnering with language mobile applications ­and course providers inPearson, Duolingo and others.­ to create a mobile learning platform to build secondary language skills.
</p>

<h3><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> Need:</h3>
<p>
 ​Second through fourth grades graders drop out of schools due to a lack of language education – an app or offering would build language skills in school as well as empower students not currently attending programs to return to schools.
</p>
<p>
  <h3><i class="fa fa-users"></i> Potential Partners:</h3> A public-private partnership, particularly the combination of partners like a Pearson, Duolingo, Rosetta Stone particularly in the case of implementing partners.
</p>

<h3><i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o"></i> Solution(s) Proposed:</h3>
<p>
  ​A complete mobile application for language education. Partnering with implementing partners like Save the Children or War Child to pilot. Incorporating local curricula tailored for refugee children, and pairing the offering with psychosocial support mechanisms and workers, and build incentives to motivate parents and children to get back in school - and keep them in school.
</p>

<h3><i class="fa fa-key"></i> Key Milestones:</h3>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>Overcoming and managing bandwidth issues and the platform’s offline capabilities; blended learning approaches at home or in learning center at school.
    </li>
    <li>
      Next Steps: ​Identify key language partners, gap analysis to identify any other existing platforms, activate on­the­ground resources to test platforms.
    </li>
    <li>
      Notes: Rosetta Stone might be leveraged quickly to deploy existing capabilities.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3><i class="fa fa-question"></i> Key questions:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      What participants have resources within existing language platforms?
    </li>
    <li>
      Can Pearson and other publishers and content owners commit to contributing data or content to this platform?
    </li>
