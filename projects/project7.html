<h2>Mapping for Success</h2>
<h3><i class="fa fa-cloud"></i> Concept:</h3>
<p>
   ​An app akin to Uber – curating and mapping on­demand opportunities based on geography, and identifying where resources can meet families’ needs locally.
</p>

<h3><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> Need:</h3>
<p>
 ​​Classrooms are full – and refugees are challenged to find jobs in the formal economy. A service­point app that allows refugee children and their families to access services and matches workers with sharing economy employment opportunities. For example, a Turkish driver has room in his car, willing to drive children to a school if compensated with a subsidy from the government. Identifies and allows employment by presenting a gig economy­like model for unemployed refugees.
</p>
<p>
  <h3><i class="fa fa-users"></i> Potential Partners:</h3> Tech companies Yelp, TaskRabbit, Uber, Airbnb and other sharing economy companies.
</p>

<h3><i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o"></i> Solution(s) Proposed:</h3>
<p>
  ​​A Yelp­ meets ­Taskrabbit ­meets ­Uber­ meets­ Airbnb for overcoming obstacles to refugee education, a modular offering that would adapt to geographies and regional needs.
</p>

<h3><i class="fa fa-key"></i> Key Milestones:</h3>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>​​Bandwidth and data access in remote areas; universality. Funding streams where peer­-to­-peer payments may not be feasible. Funding streams where credit cards might not be available.
    </li>
    <li>
      Ensure the app takes into consideration different locations of schools ­- one in the university outside the refugee camps, while one is in the city. How will they get children to a private school on private property? How will this address potential challenges working with the Jordanian government? Text­based systems will work better as smartphones and data plans won’t necessarily be commonplace.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  <h3><i class="fa fa-question"></i> Key questions:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Are there any existing text­based platforms that have executed this model successfully?
    </li>
    <li>
      What companies might be compelled to partner to bring this to life?
    </li>
  </ul>
