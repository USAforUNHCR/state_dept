<h2>Solution: Blended Online and In­-Person Education</h2>
<h3><i class="fa fa-cloud"></i> Concept:</h3>
<p>
   ​A unified approach to online and in­-person education, the “online” approach will allow the initiative to scale, while in-­person education will allow administrators to provide personal touchstones young people need in the form of workshops, monitorships and courses at local universities.
</p>

<h3><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> Need:</h3>
<p>
 T​here are no existing unified education platforms that seamlessly integrate online and in­-person education.
</p>
<p>
  <h3><i class="fa fa-users"></i> Potential Partners:</h3> Investors, mentors, universities, NGOs (Jusoor, IIE).
</p>

<h3><i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o"></i> Solution(s) Proposed:</h3>
<p> ​Business engagement and the involvement of the private sector writ large – it makes “good business sense” for individual investors to invest in young people.
</p>
