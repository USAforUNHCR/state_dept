<h2>Mapping Tool; Tangible Mobile Classroom; Mobile App to Enable Homework Reinforcement</h2>
<h3><i class="fa fa-cloud"></i> Concept:</h3>
<p>
   Leveraging existing technology, bring a classroom to refugee students who cannot easily access their school or who lack the technology to access an education digitally.
</p>

<h3><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> Need:</h3>
<p>
 R​efugee families often live on the outskirts of school districts and communities, and communities often lack space in school to bring refugee children into the classroom or existing school districts. This app and mobile classroom offering would use a mapping tool ­- RGIS - to identify outer neighborhoods where refugees cannot easily attend school.
</p>
<p>
  <h3><i class="fa fa-users"></i> Potential Partners:</h3> For the mobile classroom, Stanford d.school’s Spark Truck brings school teachers to communities with streamlined curricula. The app Rethink Education, a startup based in South Africa, delivers an online platform to compete assignments, and might provide a platform that this effort can replicate.

<h3><i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o"></i> Solution(s) Proposed:</h3>
<p>
  ​​Mobile classroom and certified curriculum.
</p>

<h3><i class="fa fa-key"></i> Key Milestones:</h3>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>​​The initiative should leverage social media like Kickstarter, Indiegogo and YouTube to fundraise.
    </li>
    <li>
      Next Steps: ​Initial coordination, funding challenges; Identifying philanthropists and foundations to support this work.
    </li>
    <li>
      Notes:​A partnership between UK Govt, UNICEF and UNHCR ­- H​umanitarian Education Accelerator​­ - is seeking smaller-scale projects to advance. The mobile classroom should incorporate a blended learning program – prioritizing online learning activities to continue education outside the confines of the modile classroom itself.
    </li>
  </ul>
