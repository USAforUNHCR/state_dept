<h2>Solution: Employment Platform</h2>
<h3><i class="fa fa-cloud"></i> Concept:</h3>
<p>
   ​A platform for Employment-­ready individuals addressing the needs of employers as well as the skills of employees
</p>

<h3><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> Need:</h3>
<p>
 ​Preparing for what happens after education, particularly for apprentice workers. Any platform must include the ability to work (outsourced work, e­work, remote work, apprenticeships) but any intervention must be <b>l​egal​</b> within the host countries, to ensure participant's safety.
</p>
<p>
  <h3><i class="fa fa-users"></i> Potential Partners:</h3> ​Linkedin, Microsoft, Google, as critical technology partners; those in the diaspora who could aid in language training, advocating for fellow Syrians among employers in regions.
</p>

<h3><i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o"></i> Solution(s) Proposed:</h3>
<p>Bringing existing initiatives in Syria onboard onto a master platform, and making any employment platform cross­-compatible with existing efforts. Any initiative must address and come packaged with a clear policy framework ­reflecting the nation-­specific challenges in the employment of Syrian refugees, and an effort to support NGOs that are already workin with refugees in areas of employment.
</p>

<h3><i class="fa fa-key"></i> Key Milestones:</h3>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>​Bring onboard Nabbesh or a similar entity ­representing existing platforms or a mentor matching platform to­ work with stakeholders and allocate funds.</li>
    <li>​Notes: Microsoft can potentially provide capabilities/services for platform. Nations like Jordan allow legal work, and likely provide a policy framework to replicate this.
    </li>
  </ul>
