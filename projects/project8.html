<h2>Mapping Tool; Tangible Mobile Classroom; Mobile App to Enable Homework Reinforcement</h2>
<h3><i class="fa fa-cloud"></i> Concept:</h3>
<p>
   Leveraging existing technology, bring the classroom to refugee students who cannot easily access their school or who lack the technology to access an education digitally.
</p>

<h3><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> Need:</h3>
<p>
 R​efugee families often live on the outskirts of school districts and communities. This app or offering would use a mapping tool ­- RGIS - to identify outer neighborhoods where refugees cannot easily attend school.
</p>
<p>
  <h3><i class="fa fa-users"></i> Potential Partners:</h3> ​Mobile classroom ­- Stanford d.school’s Spark Truck brings school teachers to communities with streamlined curricula. The app Rethink Education, a startup based in South Africa, delivers an online platform to compete assignments. It allows students to sell education data as an incentive for doing homework.
</p>

<h3><i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o"></i> Solution(s) Proposed:</h3>
<p>
  ​​A Yelp­ meets ­Taskrabbit ­meets ­Uber­ meets­ Airbnb for overcoming obstacles to refugee education, a modular offering that would adapt to geographies and regional needs.
</p>

<h3><i class="fa fa-key"></i> Key Milestones:</h3>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>​​The initiative might harness social media like Kickstarter, Indiegogo and YouTube to initially fundraise. The notion of achieving scale and inspire and support a greater number of social enterprises.
    </li>
    <li>
      Next Steps: ​Initial coordination, funding challenges; Identifying philanthropists and foundations to support this work.
    </li>
    <li>
      Notes:​A partnership between UK Govt, UNICEF, UNHCR ­- H​umanitarian Education Accelerator​­ looking for smaller scale projects ready to go to scale. The mobile classroom should incorporate a blended learning program – prioritizing online learning activities combined with blended learning.
