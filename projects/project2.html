<h2>Solution: Virtual Distance Teacher Training</h2>
<h3><i class="fa fa-cloud"></i> Concept:</h3>
<p>
   ​An attempt to address the issue of psychosocial challenges many children experience, not merely due to conflict alone but due to prevalent violence and bullying in school. This project will create a teacher training tool and curricula that empowers teachers to foster inclusion, address trauma ­and work in tandem with teachers to equip them to meet their needs and the evolving realities of the classroom.
</p>

<h3><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> Need:</h3>
<p>
 Make available nonexistent curricula and leverage as a joint employment and training tool. These communities need virtual training programs, and broader, connected communities of practice with other teachers in their region. Face to Face and virtual interaction are key to build cohorts of support.
