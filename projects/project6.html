<h2>Refugee Resource Hub Application and Site</h2>
<h3><i class="fa fa-cloud"></i> Concept:</h3>
<p>
   ​A hub to provide access to and information around services beyond language services ­– building beyond 4W’s mapping of services – a real­time location­based digital and mobile waypoint for refugees and service providers.
</p>

<h3><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> Need:</h3>
<p>
 ​Services offerings are so disperse and difficult to understand refugees need a simple, universally understandable means to access and connect various services at a local level.
</p>
<p>
  <h3><i class="fa fa-users"></i> Partners:</h3> U​niversities in computer science, Google, UNHCR in oversight of refugee
services in various countries where organizations are operating.
</p>

<h3><i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o"></i> Solution(s) Proposed:</h3>
<p>
  ​​A complete app and digital suite, easily accessible across platforms, the solution itself would allow refugees themselves to provide feedback in­app. The Yelp­like app of services that are available for refugees would allow refugees or service providers to search by type of service and area; this resource might also include employment tools and crawl existing resources to surface employment opportunities.
</p>

<h3><i class="fa fa-key"></i> Key Milestones:</h3>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>​ocal NGOs, international NGOs could all provide information on the types of work they’re doing. Applying a period of performance would ensure all content remains relevant information would expire when project finished
    </li>
    <li>
      Next Steps: ​Identify existing capabilities and organizational bandwidth to develop such an app.
    </li>
    <li>
      Notes: ICT for Programs has a service point app (IRC); via UNHCR Innovation, help.unhcr.org​ would be great to keep information current; country based resource for reference
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  <h3><i class="fa fa-question"></i> Key questions:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      What organizations have bandwidth to develop this tool?
    </li>
    <li>
      What services are the necessary, core services to include in this app?
    </li>
    <li>
      Are there any organizations or actors with services operating with location­based databases to incorporate into this initiative?
    </li>
  </ul>
