<h2>Solution: Employment Platform</h2>
<h3><i class="fa fa-cloud"></i> Concept:</h3>
<p>
   ​A platform Employment ­ready individuals addressing the needs of employers as well as the skills of employees
</p>

<h3><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> Need:</h3>
<p>
 ​Preparing for what happens after education, particularly for apprentice workers. Any platform must include the ability to work (outsourced work, e­work, remote work, apprenticeships) but any intervention must be <b>l​egal​</b> ensure safety from being deported into planning for this.
</p>
<p>
  <h3><i class="fa fa-users"></i> Potential Partners:</h3> ​Linkedin, Microsoft, Google, S​yrians or Arabs in the diaspora who could help with language training, advocating for fellow Syrians among employers in regions.
</p>

<h3><i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o"></i> Solution(s) Proposed:</h3>
<p>Not overriding existing initiatives Syrians are undertaking,but
bringing those initiatives onboard onto the same platforms, and making any employment platform cross­compatible with their existing efforts. Any initiative must address and come packaged with a clear policy framework ­ reflecting the nation­specific challenges in the employment of Syrian refugees ­ and an effort to support NGOs that are already with refugees in areas of employment. The focus will need to include onboarding existing workers onto this platform.
